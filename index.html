                Energetic, diligent, and I have been told even funny at times. I have been blessed with a great sense of duty and responsability, and I strive for greatness in everything I put hands in. I love to see not only myself succeed but everyone around me. This is the part where I list my skills but you can see those things below, I would just say that I never run away from a challenge, I have dealt with many obstacles in this life that would have allowed me to justify my shortcomings but I have risen above those times of struggle, and have become a better me each time. I hope that was to your liking, if not, keep reading below. I got mad skillzz yo.
