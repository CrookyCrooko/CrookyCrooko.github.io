                    Energetic, diligent, and occasionally funny, I've been blessed with a strong sense of duty and responsibility. I strive for excellence in everything I do and take pride in seeing those around me succeed. Instead of listing my achievements here (you'll find them below - if you into that sorta thing), I'd like to highlight my resilience and determination. I've faced numerous challenges that could have been reasons to give up, but I've tackled each one head-on and emerged stronger every time. I hope this introduction gives you a glimpse of who I am. If not, please read on - I got skills yo.
