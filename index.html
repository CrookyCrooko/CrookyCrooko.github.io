                Energetic, diligent, even funny at times, or so I've been told. I have been blessed with a great sense of duty and responsability, and I strive for greatness in everything I do. I love to see everyone around me succeed, specially me. This is the part where I try to hook you with a list of my achievements but you can see those things below, I would just say that I never say no to a challenge, I have dealt with many obstacles in this life that would have allowed me to justify running away but I have dealt with every stone thrown at me, and have become a better me each time. I hope that was to your liking, if not, keep reading below. I got mad skillzz yo.
